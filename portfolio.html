            <h1 class="project_title">Money Museum Interactive Display Proposal</h1>
            <p class="section_p">The Kansas City Money Museum asked students in the Human-Computer Interaction course to develop proposals for an interactive display panel. I specifically did the user research, mockups, and user testing.</p>
            <h3 class="section_heading">User Research</h3>
            <p class="section_p">In our research, we found that the Kansas City Money Museum has the highest amount of foot traffic compared to other Money Museums in the nation. However, after repeated visits to the museum where we talked to staff and observed visitors we noticed the following:</p>
            <ul class="section_list">
                <li class="section_list_item">The museum lacked a central area and had no exhibit organization</li>
                <li class="section_list_item">Many of the visitors were elementary or middle school children, but the content available was written at a high school reading level</li>
                <li class="section_list_item">Many of the interactive displays were outdated or difficult to use</li>
                <li class="section_list_item">There was a large underutilized display screen that only displayed tweets about the museum</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="tile2">
            <h3 class="section_heading">Project Idea</h3>
            <p class="section_p">We ultimately decided to propose that the display screen become a giant interactive display panel that would also work alongside a screen projected on the floor. This would be possible with projectors and motion sensors to capture movements. One of the team members traveled to other local museums and zoos to see how they worked in real life, and discovered plenty of other exhibitions that utilized the technology we were looking for showing that it is possible.</p>

                <img class="sketch" src="images/MMSketch3.png">
            </div>
            <p class="section_p">I created the above initial sketches to get an idea of what the team wanted. We wanted to have the screen be a prominent display in the museum that would provide a central place in the museum. From there, the screen would have a list of possible games and activities children could play with that would contain information about the museum or its role in the economy.<br><br>Given the time constraints we only developed one game, which is a quiz game about various facts in the money museum. In it, players would see questions on the main screen, and then jump on possible answers on the floor. They would get immediate feedback (either a red X or a small fireworks animation) and the game would not use a points system to keep the game simple.</p>

            <h3 class="section_heading">Iteration</h3>
            <p class="section_p">I designed the mockups seen here, working off initial sketches. When the screen was in standby mode, the bottom floor would be a collection of coins that kids could walk or run through. When they want to play a game, they'd go to the main screen and select a game by either swiping the screen or using the bottom horizontal bar. For the Quiz Game, users would be directed to stand behind the line and clear the game floor. The quiz would start and show off the different questions with 20 seconds for players to jump on the right answer when it appears. When it is done, a small blurb about the question, before moving into the next question. </p>

            <h3 class="section_heading">User Testing</h3>
            <p class="section_p">I also facilitated the User Testing as well. My test user was a young boy in the neighborhood who had no familial ties to the museum, and was fairly apathetic about the money museum. Because we did not actually have a projector screen, I ended up using a large computer screen to mimic the large screen. For the projector screen on the floor, I used pieces of papers with answers on them, and put them on the floor for a couple of seconds, before switching it out with another possible answer on another part of the floor. The user was able to play the game successfully, and was only confused when the quiz restarted (he wasn't sure if he needed to move to the back) but once the game continued regardless of where he was on the floor, he got the hang of it and played the rest of the round successfully.</p>

            <h3 class="section_heading">Summary</h3>
            <p class="section_p">From the user testing, the game was fairly fun and got the test user to interact with the student. Due to the short timeframe of the project, we only had one test user, and would have had more if we were given more time. </p>

            <h1 class="project_title">Different Grind Coffee Shop</h1> 
            <p class="section_p">I had to come up with a coffee shop, and create a logo for the coffee shop, as well as creating several magazine advertisements and poster ads. I came up with a concept called the Different Grind that would cater to students and working professionals, who could rent out a study/work space for a certain block of time, where they have unlimited wifi, cheap printing, and access to discounted food and drink. They could also order food or coffee online. </p>
