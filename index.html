        	<p>I'm a User Experience designer currently studying Computer Science and Graphic Design. My combination of programming and design allows me to not only make beautiful and efficient interfaces, but also develop the code to make them real. I've worked on projects by myself and in groups, and have extensive leadership experience in several organizations. Check out my portfolio for more of my work, and my resume to see my extensive work history.</p>
